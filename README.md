FlightBuddy is an application that assists users in catching a flight from the moment they leave their house to when their plane is about to take off. It displays all relevant flight information and provides real-time updates of any status, traffic, gate, or terminal changes. The user simply has to input the flight number, airline, and date into their phone and the watch displays instructions of where to go/what to do next and sends notifications of any important changes.

This repository includes the android files and images, as well as the framer files.
